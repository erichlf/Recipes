Here's the recipe:
OG 1.088
90% pilsner malt
10% amber malt

Hops:
16 AAU Amarillo hops
8 AAU Simcoe hops
8 AAU Warrior hops
Divided up evenly over the 90 minute boil
Dry Hops:
1oz Amarillo
0.5oz Simcoe
0.5oz Warrior

Yeast: Wyeast 1099
Procedure:
Mash in at 122F and then raise to 149F until conversion. Boil for 105 minutes (I needed to boil longer) and start adding hops at the 88 minute mark. I talked earlier how I figured out my hops, but if you use pellets you would have to work out something different.
Mine has now been in bottles for a week (may sample one tonight), but my sample was incredible. I will say that I thought the 10% amber was a little too dark, so I lowered mine to 7.5% amber malt. Good luck and happy brewing.
