#+DESCRIPTION: Vegan Pie Crust
* Ingredients:
- 2 - 4 T ice water
- 2 C flour
- 2 T sugar
- 1 tsp salt
- 4 Oz Cold Plant Based Butter (cubed)
- 1/2 C Crisco shortening

* Method:
1. Preheat oven to 400F.
2. Stir the flour, salt, and sugar together in a bowl.
3. Cut the cold butter into the flour mixture until it forms dime size pieces.
4. Then cut the shortening into the mixture until it forms dime size pieces.
5. Add the ice water gradually until it forms a dough.
6. Place in refrigerator while you make the filling.
7. Dust your surface with flour and cut your dough ball in half.
8. Roll out half the dough into a circle, and place in pie tin.
9. Place filling in and then roll out the second half of dough and place on top.
10. Bake at 400F for about an hour or until golden brown.

* Note:
It is important to not handle the pie crust too much and try to keep it cold until
you cook it. This will result in a flaky crust.
