#+DESCRIPTION: Fudgy Vegan Brownies
* Ingredient:
  - 1/2 C Flour
  - 1 1/4 C Water
  - 2 2/3 C Sugar
  - 1 1/2 tsp Salt
  - 2 tsp Vanilla
  - 1 C Cocoa
  - 2/3 C Vegetable Oil
  - 2 C flour
  - 1 tsp Baking Powder
  - 3/4 C Chopped Nuts (Optional)

* Method:
  - In a saucepan cook the 1/2 C flour water and sugar over low heat. This will
    thicken, the thicker it is the fudgier the brownie. Obviously don't dry
    this out too much.
  - When the above mixture has cooled add salt, vanilla, cocoa, and vegetable oil
    and mixture thoroughly.
  - Mix remaining flour and baking powder into mixture. Use your judgment on how
    much of the remaining flour to add. The thicker the flour paste from the first
    step means you will likely want to add less flour now. This mixture will be
    quite thick though.
  - Mix in nuts.
  - "Pour" mixture into a greased 9x9 pan.
  - Bake at 350F for 25 minutes or until a tooth pick can be inserted into the
    center and come out clean.
