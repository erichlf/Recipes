Pie crust

	# 2 - 4 tablespoons ice water
	# 2 cups flour
	# 2 tablespoons sugar
	# 1 teaspoon salt
	# 4 ounces (1 stick) cold unsalted butter, cut into 16 pieces
	# 1/2 cup Crisco shortening 

Stir the flour, salt, and sugar together in a bowl. Cut the cold butter into the
flour mixture until it forms dime size pieces. Then cut the shortening into the
mixture until it forms dime size pieces. Now add the ice water gradually until
it forms a dough. Place in refrigerator while you make the filling. Dust your
surface with flour and cut your dough ball in half. Roll out half the dough into
a circle, and place in pie tin. Place filling in and then roll out the second
half of dough and place on top. Bake at 400F for about an hour or until golden
brown.
