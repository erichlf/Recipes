Base layer
    170g dates
    75g cashew nuts
    65g cup pecans
    3 tbsp maple syrup
    2 tbsp cocoa nibs

Chocolate topping
    1 tbsp coconut oil
    3 heaped tbsp cocoa powder
    3 tbsp maple syrup
    2 tbsp chia seeds
    50g dates
    40g pecans or cashew nuts

Method

Soak chia seeds in a bowl with 8 tbsp of water and leave aside. Place all the
base layer ingredients in a food processor and blend until combined and sticking
together. Press the mixture into the bottom of an inch-deep tray.

Next, place all the topping ingredients in the processor with the chia seeds and
most of the water then blend until smooth. Stop to taste the mix, and if you
like it a bit sweeter add a little more maple syrup.

Scoop the topping out and smear on top of the base layer, then put the tray in
the freezer for at least an hour. Once it's set it's ready to cut into
portions. You can store it in the fridge and it will last a week, or in freezer
if you've done a big batch.
