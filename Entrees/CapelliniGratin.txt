Capellini Gratin

1 lb capellini
3/4 cup heavy cream
1 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmigiano or Peccorino
1/2 t freshly ground nutmeg
a pinch of piment d’esplette (or paprika)
sea salt
black pepper
butter

Lightly butter your baking dish of choice, and preheat the oven to 425F.

Cook the capellini according to the package directions until al dente.

While the pasta is cooking, stir together a slurry of the cream, half of the
grated cheese, and the spices. Using a pasta spoon, scoop the pasta out of the
water and into the cream mixture. Stir well to coat each strand… if it seems too
dry, add it a bit of the pasta water. Let it sit for a couple of minutes.

Transfer the pasta to your baking dish. If you are using a muffin tin, fill each
almost to the top with spirals of bunches of pasta. If you are using a baking
sheet, just spread evenly. Now, if you still have some liquid in the bowl, pour
enough on so you can just see it starting to show through the top layer of
pasta. If you are out of liquid, get a bit more cream, and top it off. If you
want a crunchier pasta, don’t fill it quite as high. Then, top off with the rest
of the grated cheese.

Bake until the top is golden and bubbly. Let the gratin cool for 5 to 10 minutes
to firm up before serving. Garnish with fresh herbs, fried shallots, or a little
pesto. Yum!
