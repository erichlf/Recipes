Homemade Ramen Noodles

Serves 4

Nonstick cooking spray
7 ounces shiitake mushrooms, stems removed, thinly sliced
4 garlic cloves, minced
1-inch piece ginger, peeled, minced
1 finely minced hot chile pepper (with or without seeds, depending in how spicy you like it)
1/4 teaspoon Chinese five spice
5-ounce package Japanese curly noodles or Chuka soba
1 cup reduced-sodium beef broth
4 cups baby spinach
1 tablespoon butter
2 scallions
1/4 cup cilantro leaves

Heat a large skillet over high heat. Coat with a layer of cooking spray. Add the mushrooms and cook 1 to 2 minutes, stirring once or twice until the mushrooms start to soften (add one tablespoon of water if they begin to stick).

Add the garlic, ginger and chile, and reduce heat to medium. Cook another 1 to 2 minutes until the mushrooms are cooked and the garlic is fragrant.

Sprinkle over the Chinese five spice and stir to coat. Add the noodles and broth. Cover and reduce heat. Simmer 4 to 5 minutes until the noodles are tender.

Add the spinach and butter, and cook 1 to 2 minutes more until the spinach is wilted. Garnish with scallions and cilantro and serve immediately.
