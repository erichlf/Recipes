Crust:
1 1/4 C. Flour
1 T. Sugar
1/4 t. Salt
2 Oz. Unsalted Butter
1/4 C. Crisco
4 T. Cold Water

Mix dry ingredient together. Cut in cold butter until mixture forms little
balls, then do the same for the crisco. Now add water a table spoon at a time,
until a dough ball forms. Place in refrigerator for 10 mins. 

Filling:
Olive Oil for Sautéing
1 Small Onion Diced
1 Clove Garlic Minced
1 Green Pepper
1 Red Pepper
1 Tomato Diced
1 C. Mushrooms Sliced
1 C. Chopped Broccoli
1 1/2 C. Shredded Cheddar
1/4 C. Grated Parmesan

Sauté onions and garlic then add peppers, tomato, mushrooms, and broccoli. Sauté
until veggies become tender. 

Custard:
5 Eggs
1/4 C. Milk

Wisk together eggs and milk.

Roll out pie crust and place in pie tin. Bake covered with tinfoil and held down
with weights (I use dried beans) at 450F for 5 mins, remove tinfoil and bake for
another 5 mins. Remove from oven and reduce temp to 350F. Place veggies in crust
and spread cheese over top of veggies. Now pour the custard mixture over veggies
and bake for 30-40 mins.
