For the cauliflower:

    1. Preheat your oven to 230C, and spray a baking sheet with oil or cooking spray.

    4. Toss the cauliflower in the batter until thoroughly coated.
    5. Arrange the cauliflower on the baking sheet in a single layer.

    7. Remove from the oven and gently flip and toss the cauliflower in the sauce on the sheet to coat.
    8. Return to the oven for another 5 minutes.
