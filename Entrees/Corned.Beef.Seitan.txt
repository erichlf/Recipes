Corned Beef Seitan
1¼ c wheat gluten
½ tbsp mustard
½ tbsp pepper
1 tsp coriander
1 tsp salt
½ tsp cloves
½ tsp red pepper
½ tsp cinnamon
½ tsp allspice
1 c cold water
½ c kidney beans, mashed
2 tbsp oil
½” ginger root, grated
1 clove garlic, minced
1 tbsp brown sugar
1 tbsp tomato paste

Preheat oven to 325°. In a small bowl, mix together dry ingredients, wheat
gluten through allspice. In a medium bowl, mix together remaining ingredients.
Combine the wet and dry mixtures together until well-blended, and knead the
mixture for a minute or two to condition the gluten. Shape dough into a 9-10″
log and roll tightly (double-roll, if you have to!) in aluminum foil, twisting
the ends to seal. Bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes, rotating once. Let cool fully;
slice, and serve. It’s easier to make thinner slices if you chill the log in the
refrigerator for a couple of hours first.
