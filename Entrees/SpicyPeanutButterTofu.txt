Ingredients:
22 oz Tofu, cut into 1 inch cubes

Sauce:
4 T. Peanut Butter
4 T. Soy Sauce
4 tsp. Sugar
2 T. Red Chili Sauce
2 tsp. Mirin
2 tsp. Ground Ginger
3 cloves of Garlic
6 T. water

Method:
* Preheat the oven to 375°F / 190°C
* Mix all of the ingredients for the spicy peanut sauce together
* Cut the tofu into 1 inch (2.5cm) cubes
* Add sauce to the tofu, stir, cover and marinade in the fridge for 2-3 hours
  or, ideally, overnight. Tempeh is really good at absorbing the flavors of the
  marinade
* Place the tofu on a nonstick baking sheet, spray with some coconut oil, bake
  in the oven for 25-30 minutes. Save any leftover marinade for serving.
