Spicy Black Bean Patties

  2 Cups dry black beans (or 2 16 ounce cans)
  2 Jalepenos, diced but keep the seeds
  1 red pepper, diced
  1/2 green pepper, diced
  1/2 red onion, diced
  4 cloves garlic, diced
  1 Cup breadcrumbs
  1 Teaspoon cumin
  1 Teaspoon chili powder
  1 Teaspoon oregano
  Oil for frying
  Salt and pepper

Making the patties. Once your veggies are chopped, saute them in a few
tablespoons of oil until they are a bit soft, but not browned at all.  Just a
few minutes should do the trick.

Cook the beans according to the directions on the package.  If you are using dry
beans, which I recommend, you’ll want to soak them overnight so plan for that.

Once your beans are cooked, add your breadcrumbs and using a masher or large
spoon, mash up the beans and breadcrumbs.  I wouldn’t use a food processor for
these because you run the risk of over processing the beans.  You want them to
still have plenty of texture, but just broken up a bit.

Mix in your sauteed veggies and all your other spices.  Feel free to adjust the spices if you want the patties even spicier.

Then form about 4 ounce patties with the mixture.  You should be able to get
about 10 12 patties out of the mixture.  To finish these guys off, cook them in
a few tablespoons of oil over medium high heat for about 4 minutes a side.
These will give the burgers a good crust on the outside and heat them up all the
way through.  We sprinkled some more spices (chili powder and cumin) on each
patty before frying them up.
