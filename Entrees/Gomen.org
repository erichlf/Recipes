- 1/2 tsp Ginger Powder

1. Strip the leafy greens of the vegetable from the thick spine that runs through each leaf.
2. Coarsely chop the greens, and then boil them in water until theyâ€™re very soft and tender,
   about 45-60 minutes.
3. Drain the water, but reserve just a little for the next step.
4. In a new pot, cook the onions and garlic in the olive oil for until the onions become
   translucent.
5. Add ginger and stir the mixture cooking it for a minute.
6. Add the well-cooked greens and just a little bit of water.

   are very soft.

   cook them.
