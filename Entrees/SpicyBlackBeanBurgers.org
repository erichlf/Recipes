#+DESCRIPTION: Spicy Black Bean Burgers
* Ingredients
- 2 C Dry Black Beans (or 2 16 Oz Cans)
- 2 Jalepenos (diced)
- 1 Red Pepper (diced)
- 1/2 Green Pepper (diced)
- 1/2 Onion (diced)
- 4 Cloves Garlic (diced)
- 1 C Breadcrumbs
- 1 tsp cumin
- 1 tsp chili powder
- 1 tsp oregano
- Oil for frying
- Salt and pepper

* Method:
1. Saute veggies in a few tablespoons of oil until they are a bit soft, but not browned.
2. Cook the beans according to the directions on the package.  If you are using dry
   beans youâ€™ll need to soak them overnight.
3. Add your breadcrumbs to beans and mash up the beans and breadcrumbs. You want them to
   still have plenty of texture, but just broken up a bit.
4. Mix in your sauteed veggies and all your other spices.
5. Form about 4 Oz patties.
6. Cook in a few tablespoons of oil over medium high heat for about 4 minutes per side
   or until browned.
