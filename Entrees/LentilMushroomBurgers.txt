Ingredients

    1 T. extra-virgin olive oil, divided
    3/4 C. chopped onion
    2 garlic cloves, chopped
    5 regular or whole-wheat hamburger buns, toasted and divided
    6 oz. presliced cremini mushrooms
    8 oz. cooked lentils
    4 tsp. Dijon mustard, divided
    2 tsp. chopped fresh thyme
    1/2 tsp. freshly ground black pepper
    1/4 tsp. kosher salt
    1 large egg, lightly beaten

Preparation
1. Preheat broiler.
2. Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add 1 tsp. oil to
    pan; swirl to coat. Add onion and garlic; saute minutes or until onion is
    tender. Remove from heat.
3. Place 1 bun in a food processor; process until coarse crumbs form. Remove
    breadcrumbs from food processor; set aside.
4. Combine mushrooms, lentils, 2 tsp. mustard, and the next 3 ingredients
    (through salt) in food processor; pulse to combine.
5. Combine onion mixture, breadcrumbs, mushroom mixture, and egg in a large
    bowl, stirring well. Divide mixture into 4 equal portions, gently shaping
    each into a 1/2-inch-thick patty. Heat a large nonstick skillet over
    medium-high heat. Add the remaining 2 tsp. oil to pan; swirl to coat.
    Add patties; cook for 4 minutes on each side or until browned. Remove
    patties from pan; arrange in a single layer on a baking sheet.
    Place under broiler for 2 minutes or until cheese is softened.
