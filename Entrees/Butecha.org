- 6 T Chick Pea Flour
- 2 T Lemon Juice
- 1/4 tsp Turmeric Powder
- 1/2 tsp Ginger Powder
- 1 Jalapeno (seeded and finely chopped)
- 1/4 C Onions (finely chopped)
- 2 C Water

* Method:
1. Measure two cups of water into a bowl, and dissolve about 6 T of chick pea flour in
   the water.
2. Add the olive oil and the lemon juice mixing the ingredients well.
3. Add the turmeric and ginger continuing to mix until mixture is smooth.
4. Place in a large pot.
5. Turn on the heat to low-medium, and bring it to a lightly bubbling boil.
6. When the mixture begins to bubble, adjust the heat so that it doesn't spit and splatter.
7. Once mixture has thickened, remove from the heat and pour the butecha into a bowl.
8. Add the finely chopped onions and jalapeno.
9. Stir it all together thoroughly.
10. Cover and refrigerate for a few hours. It should look like scrambled eggs after you stir it.
11. Mix and serve hot or cold, reheating in a microwave before serving if you prefer it hot.
