#+DESCRIPTION: Ayib
* Ingredients:
- 1/2 Gal Milk
- 2/3 C Lemon Juice

* Method:
1. Bring the milk to a boil over high heat.
2. Reduce the heat to medium and pour in the lemon juice.
3. Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring constantly, until curds begin to form.
4. Remove from heat.
5. Line a sieve or colander with cheesecloth (or use a very fine sieve).
6. Spoon the curdled milk into the sieve or colander and rinse with cold, running water
   to remove any lingering lemon flavor from the curds.
