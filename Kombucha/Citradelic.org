#+DESCRIPTION: Citradelic
* Ingredients:
- 1 Gal Kombucha
- 4 g Citra Hops (pellets)
- 40 g Sugar
- 750 ml Water (for hop tea method)

* Method:
** Dry Hopped:
1. Add hops to fermentation vessel (minus SCOBY and starter liquid).
2. Let dry hop for 3 days.
3. Remove hops.
4. Mix in sugar.
5. Bottle.

** Hop Tea:
1. Boil hops in water for about 30 minutes.
2. Let hop tea cool to less than 32C (90F).
3. Remove hops.
4. Mix in sugar.
5. Add hop tea to kombucha.
6. Bottle.

* Notes:
Use a hop bag or it will be messy.

Dry hopping will produce a nice citrus sweetness, while hop tea will give bitterness.
Experiment with a mixture of the two methods. You can even experiment with adding hops
to the hop tea at different times during the boil.
