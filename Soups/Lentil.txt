2 cups (400 g) green lentils, rinsed
7 cups (1600 ml) water
14 ounces (400g) mirepoix blend vegetables
8 ounces (220 g) Yukon Gold potatoes, cubed
2 servings vegetable bouillon cubes (I used one large Not-Beef Broth Cube, which is gluten-free)
1 teaspoon oregano
1 teaspoon basil
1/2 teaspoon crushed rosemary
3 bay leaves
4 garlic cloves, chopped

14.5 ounce can crushed tomatoes (use fire-roasted for best flavor)
freshly ground pepper, to taste
1/8 teaspoon hickory salt (or other smoked salt), optional
salt, to taste
additional seasonings, to taste
2 teaspoons red wine vinegar

Place lentils, water, and next 7 ingredients into pressure cooker or large pot.

For pressure cooking, seal the cooker and bring to high pressure. Cook under pressure for 10 minutes. Remove from heat and allow pressure to come down for 5 minutes. Then, release any remaining pressure and return to very low heat. Add tomatoes, pepper, and both salts, and taste to check seasonings. If necessary, add more to taste (I added more oregano and garlic). Cook uncovered for at least 15 minutes, adding more water if it seems to thick, and stirring from the bottom often. Stir in vinegar just before serving.

For regular cooking, bring to a boil, stir well, cover pot, and cook over low heat until lentils are tender, about an hour. (Add additional water if it begins to dry out.) Add tomatoes, pepper, and both salts, and taste to check seasonings. If necessary, add more to taste (I added more oregano and garlic). Cook uncovered for at least 15 minutes, adding more water if it seems to thick, and stirring from the bottom often. Stir in vinegar just before serving.
