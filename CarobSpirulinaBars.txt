Ingredients:
1/4 C. Dried Apricots
2 T. Spirulina Powder
1 C. Carob Powder
1/8 tsp. Sea Salt
1/2 C. whole, Raw Flaxseeds
1 C. whole, Raw Pumpkin Seeds
1 C. whole, Raw Sunflower Seeds
1 1/2 C. Crispy Brown Rice Cereal
3/4 C. Honey
1 C. Peanut Butter

Method:
Line an 8 x 8-inch baking pan or 9 x 13-inch baking pan with parchment paper.

Add the dried apricots to a large food processor and pulse to create a paste.
Remove the paste from the food processor and set aside.

In a large heatproof bowl, toss together the spirulina powder, carob powder, and
sea salt, and combine well, using your hands if needed.

In a large stockpot over low heat, melt the honey, almond butter, and reserved
apricot paste and mix well with a rubber spatula for 2 to 3 minutes to
incorporate. Make sure the mixture is smooth and free of any lumps.

Carefully remove the pot from the heat and fold in the flaxseeds, pepitas,
sunflower seeds, and crispy rice cereal and mix well to combine and coat. Using
a spatula, carefully transfer the seed mixture to the dry mixture and fold to
combine. Be careful not to crush the crisp rice!

When the bar mixture is well combined, use a rubber spatula to gently press the
mixture into the prepared baking pan, flattening to make 3/4 â€“ to 1-inch bars.
Allow the mixture to cool and harden. Cut into small squares or rectangles
