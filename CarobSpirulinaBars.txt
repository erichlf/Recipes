Ingredients:
50 g. Dried Apricots
15 g. Spirulina Powder
125 g. Carob Powder
1/8 tsp. Sea Salt
140 g. whole, Raw Pumpkin Seeds
80 g. whole, Raw Sunflower Seeds
250 g. Honey
250 g. Peanut Butter
2 Scoops Chocolate Protein Powder

Method:
Line an 8 x 8-inch baking pan or 9 x 13-inch baking pan with parchment paper.

Add the dried apricots to a large food processor and pulse to create a paste.
Remove the paste from the food processor and set aside.

In a large heatproof bowl, toss together the spirulina powder, carob powder,
protein powder and sea salt, and combine well, using your hands if needed.

In a pot over low heat, melt the honey, almond butter, and reserved apricot
paste and mix well with a rubber spatula for 2 to 3 minutes to incorporate. Make
sure the mixture is smooth and free of any lumps.

Carefully remove the pot from the heat and fold in the pumpkin seeds and
sunflower seeds and mix well to combine and coat. Using a spatula, carefully
transfer the seed mixture to the dry mixture and fold to
combine. Be careful not to crush the crisp rice!

When the bar mixture is well combined, use a rubber spatula to gently press the
mixture into the prepared baking pan, flattening to make 3/4 â€“ to 1-inch bars.
Allow the mixture to cool and harden. Cut into small squares or rectangles
