Ingredients

2 C shredded low-moisture part-skim Mozzarella 
3 egg yolks
1 tsp granulated garlic
butter & olive oil for sauteing

Method:

Place cheese and garlic in a microwave safe bowl and toss around to combine.
Melt cheese in microwave for about 1 to 1 1/2 minutes.

Fold in one egg yolk at a time until a homogeneous dough forms. This actually
takes a little elbow grease!

Portion dough into 4 balls.

Chill in refrigerator for at least 10 minutes.

Lightly grease a silpat or parchment (and your hands-it helps from sticking!)
and roll out each ball into a 14-15″ log.  Slice each log into 1″ pieces. (If
you like, you can press the tip of a fork onto each piece to get that “gnocchi”
look but it’s not necessary)

In a large pot, bring about a half gallon of salted water to a boil (like you
would for normal pasta).  Place all the gnocchi into the pot and cook until they
float, about 2-3 minutes. Then strain into a colander.

Heat a large non-stick pan on medium-high heat. Add a tablespoon of butter and a
tablespoon of oil to pan.  Add gnocchi and saute each side for about 1-2
minutes, until golden brown.

Season with salt and pepper and serve!
