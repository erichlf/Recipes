#+DESCRIPTION: Authentic Indian Vegetable Samosa
* Ingredients:
** Dough:
- 1/2 C all purpose flour
- 1/2 T semolina flour
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 11/2 Ts oil
- 1/4 C minus 2 T cold water
** Filling:
- 3 large boiled potatoes, peeled and chopped into very small cubes
- 1/2 tsp cumin seeds
- 2 chopped green chilies
- 1 tsp coriander powder
- 1/4 tsp garam masala
- 1 tsp mango powder
- 1 tsp salt
- 2 Ts oil
- 1/2 C green peas (frozen)

* Method
** Dough:
1. Mix the all purpose flour, semolina flour, salt, and oil.
2. Add the water and knead the dough for about 1 to 2 minutes.
3. Let the dough sit for at least 15 minutes, covered with a damp cloth.

** Filling:
1. Heat the oil in a frying pan. Test the heat by adding one cumin seed to
the oil; if it cracks right away oil is ready.
2. Add cumin seeds and cook until they all crack.
3. Add green chilies, coriander powder and stir for few seconds.
4. Add green peas and stir until tender.
5. Add the cubed potatoes and stir-fry for about 4 minutes.
6. Stir in garam masala and mango powder.
7. Add more salt or mango powder according to taste.
8. Let the filling cool to room temperature.

** Making the Samosa
1. Knead the dough for a few seconds.
2. Divide the dough into 4 equal parts and make into balls.
3. Roll each ball into 6-inch diameter circles and cut each circle in half.
4. Brush some water along the edge of one semicircle.
5. Pick this semicircle up with both hands and fold it into a cone shape.
6. Pinch the side of this cone so that it is completely sealed.
7. Fill the cone with 3 T of filling.
8. Press this filling down with your fingers.
9. Now close the top of this cone into a triangle shape, pinching the top
edge so that it is completely sealed.
10. Repeat this for rest of the samosa filling each with 3 T with the potato
mixture.
11. Heat the oil in a frying pan on medium heat. To check if oil is hot enough place
a small piece of dough in oil and dough should sizzle and come to the surface
slowly. The frying pan should have at least 1 inch of oil.
12. Place the samosas in the frying pan a few at a time.
13. Once the samosas are floating on top of the oil turn them slowly.
14. Fry the samosas for about 3 to 4 minutes or until the samosas
turn a light golden-brown color on all sides.


* Tips
- Try to handle the dough as little as possible and keep it cold. This will
result in a nice flaky crust.
- The dough has to be kneaded well; otherwise, the samosas will not come out as crisp.
- If the filled samosas sit for too long, they will dry. To avoid this, cover with a
damp cloth. Better yet place them in the refrigerator.
- If you use a high heat, the samosa crust will be too soft and not crispy.

Makes 8 samosas.
