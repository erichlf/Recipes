Ingredients:
3 1/2 cups flaked coconut
2 tablespoons liquid smoke
1 tablespoon Braggs liquid aminos or soy sauce
1 tablespoon pure maple syrup
1 tablespoon water
1 teaspoon smoked paprika (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees.
Combine liquid smoke, braggs, maple syrup, and water in a large mixing bowl.
Pour in flaked coconut, using a wooden spoon to gently toss the coconut in the
liquid mixture. If adding smoked paprika, add and toss to coat evenly. Once the
coconut is evenly coated, pour it onto a non-stick baking sheet and slide it the
oven. Bake for 20-25 minutes, using a spatula to flip the 'bacon' about every 5
minutes so it cooks evenly. This stuff WILL burn if you're not keeping an eye on
it and regularly flipping it, so please do.
