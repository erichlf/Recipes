Ingredients:
6 T chick pea flour
2 T lemon juice
¼ tsp turmeric powder (optional)
½ tsp ginger powder
1 large jalapeño, seeded and finely chopped
¼ C finely chopped onions
2 C water
2 T olive oil

Method:
Measure two cups of water into a bowl, and dissolve about 6 tablespoons of chick pea flour in the water (three
tablespoons for every cup of water, plus just a touch more). Add the olive oil and the lemon juice, mix the
ingredients, then add the turmeric and ginger.

When the mixture is smooth, put it into a large pot. Turn on the heat to low-medium, and bring it to a lightly
bubbling boil. When the mixture begins to bubble, adjust the heat so that it doesn’t spit and splatter. You
may want to put some aluminum foil loosely over the top. Don’t put a lid on it! The butecha needs to thicken,
and that happens when the water slowly boils away. The volume will reduce as it cooks.

When it’s thickened, which will take at least half an hour, remove it from the heat and pour the butecha into
the bowl in which you will refrigerate it.

Add the finely chopped onions and jalapeño. Stir it all together thoroughly. You can add a little extra onion
and jalapeño if you like, but don’t overwhelm it with these ingredients. Refrigerate the butecha, and stir it
thoroughly a few hours later. It should look like scrambled eggs after you stir it.

Serve hot or cold, reheating in a microwave before serving if you prefer it hot. Mix the ingredients one more
time before reheating.
