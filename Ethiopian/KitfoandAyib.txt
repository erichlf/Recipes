Kitfo & Ayib:
1 pound finely ground low-fat beef
4-6 T niter kibbee (Ethiopian spiced butter), or more to taste (ghee is an adequate substitute)
1 tsp mitmita powder, or more to taste
1 tsp cardamom powder, or more to taste
32 ounces of buttermilk or plain yogurt

To prepare the dish tere, or raw, melt the niter kibbee in a skillet using low heat. When itâ€™s hot and liquefied, remove the skillet from the heat, add the beef and mix the two ingredients well. Add the spices and mix well again. If you want it lebleb, or slightly cooked, return it to the heat for a minute before adding the spices.

To prepare it yebesele, or fully cooked, put the beef and niter kibbee in a skillet, and over low heat, stir constantly until the kibbee melts and the beef is cooked to your liking. Turn off the heat, add the spices, and mix the ingredients well.

To make ayib, boil the buttermilk or yogurt over low heat for about 15 or 20 minutes, until the liquid whey separates from the soft white curds. Gently pour off the whey, getting rid of as much of the liquid as you can. The curds left behind is your ayib. Allow it to cool a little before the meal.

Serve the kitfo with dollops of ayib surrounding it, or mix some ayib right into the kitfo.
