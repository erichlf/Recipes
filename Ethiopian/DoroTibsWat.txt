Doro Tibs Wot:
2 large or 3 small chicken breast fillets
1 C very finely chopped onions
¼ C red wine or t’ej
3/4 to 1 T berbere, to taste
2 jalapeños, seeded and cut into slices
4 T niter kibbee (spiced clarified butter) or olive oil

Cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces.

In a hot frying pan over medium heat, cook the onions, turning and stirring them often, until they begin to lightly brown and caramelize. Don’t let them burn.

When they seem like they might soon begin to burn if you cook them any longer, add the kibbee or oil, and stir the mixture. If you use kibbee, wait until it’s all melted until you add the next ingredients.

Add the berbere, and stir it into the moist sizzling onions. Let it cook for a minute, stirring it constantly. Then add the wine, and mix the ingredients together well. The wine will begin to cook off almost immediately.

Add the chicken and stir the mixture, then let it cook for a few minutes until the chicken begins to turn white on the outside. Slowly add 1/2 to 3/4 cups of water, bring it just to a boil, and reduce the heat. Finally, add the sliced jalapeños.

Let it all simmer until the liquid is almost cooked off and the doro tibs remain in a thick red sauce, about 15 to 20 minutes.
