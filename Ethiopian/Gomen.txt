Gomen:
1 pound of collard greens or kale
1/2 C of finely chopped onions
2 T olive oil
1/2 tsp chopped garlic, or a little more to taste
1/2 tsp ginger powder, or a little more to taste

Strip the leafy greens of the vegetable from the thick spine that runs through each leaf, using nothing of the spines. Coarsely chop the greens, and then boil them in water until they’re very soft and tender, about 45 to 60 minute. When they’re ready, drain the water, but reserve just a little for the next step.

In a new pot, cook the onions and garlic in the olive oil for a few minutes until the onions begin to glisten. If necessary, add just a little water to keep them from burning. Now add the ginger, stir the mixture, and cook it for a minute more.

Add the well-cooked greens and just a little bit of water. Let the greens, onions and spices simmer until the water begins to cook off and the greens are very soft. You can always pour off excess water when the greens are ready or add water if they become to dry as you cook them.
