Ingredients:
1/2 gallon milk (8 cups or 2 quarts)
2/3 C lemon juice

Method:
Bring the milk to a boil over high heat.  Reduce the heat to medium and pour in the lemon juice.  Reduce heat
to low and cook, stirring constantly, until curds begin to form.  Remove from heat.

Line a sieve or colander with cheesecloth (or use a very fine sieve).  Spoon the curdled milk into the sieve
or collander and rinse with cold, running water to remove any lingering lemon flavor from the curds.
Refrigerate and let drain for 8 hours or overnight.

Discard the liquid.
