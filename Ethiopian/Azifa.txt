Ingredients:
1 C green lentils
1 large jalapeño pepper, seeded and finely chopped
1/4 C finely chopped onions
1 tsp ginger powder, or to taste
1/4 tsps of turmeric powder, or to taste
3 T lime juice, or to taste
2 T olive oil

Method:
Boil the lentils in water until they’re soft, about 30 minutes. Then, drain them well using a strainer, rinse
them with cold water, and put them into a mixing bowl.

Using a large spatula, stir the lentils until they begin to become somewhat mashed. Chop the onions and
jalapeños into very small pieces but do not liquefy them.

Mix the onions, jalapeño, ginger, turmeric, lime juice and olive oil into the lentils. Stir them together
well. When it’s all mixed, taste the azifa. If the flavor or any one ingredient doesn’t peek through, add a
bit more of that ingredient. You should be able to taste the flavors of the various elements, all blended
harmoniously. You might also add a little bit of each ingredient, then more of it until you have a nice
balance of distinct flavors. Put it in the refrigerator to chill for dinner.
