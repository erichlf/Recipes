Ingredients:
1 piece of injera
2 or 3 T of niter kibbee
1/2 to 3/4 tsp of berbere, or more to taste

Method:
Divide the injera in half or into quarters, and in a skillet, heat the pieces until they become just a little
crispy (just a little!). Turn them frequently as you heat them.

Melt the kibbee in a microwave, then add the berbere and blend the ingredients well. When the injera is ready,
spread the spiced kibbee onto the bubbly side of the injera like you’re buttering bread. This dish is
excellent before a meal with an apéritif of tej, or you can just enjoy it as a snack any time.
