  This attractive dish resembles salmon casserole. But we know it's not! Adding more kelp, dulse or any other sea veggies that you have on hand will increase the seafood flavor. For fun, press into a mold and unmold onto a platter, surrounded with kale and parsley, topped with almonds or olives. This dish is elegant served with warmed Mushroom Gravy. For a luncheon or brunch this recipe is lovely served in a scooped out tomato.

2 cups almonds, soaked 8-10 hours
2 whole carrots
1/2 cup coarsely chopped red onion
1 1/2 cups finely minced celery
1/2 cup minced parsley
1/4 cup minced shallot or scallion
1/4 cup lemon juice
2 teaspoons kelp powder
1 teaspoon dulse powder or granules
1 tablespoon liquid aminos, 2 teaspoons Nama Shoyu or 1 teaspoon sea salt

Soak almonds 8-12 hours, drain, rinse and drain again. Put the almonds, carrots and onions through the heavy-duty juicer, using the blank screen. Place mixture in a large bowl, add celery, parsley, shallots, lemon juice, kelp, dulse, liquid aminos or sea salt and stir thoroughly. Shape into a mold or place in a pie crust. Or shape free hand like a fish. Keeps several days, covered, in the refrigerator. Serves 4-6.
