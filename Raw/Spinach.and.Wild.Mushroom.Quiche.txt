Makes 4 small quiches

This recipe will require you to make the bases ahead of time.

For the base
1c cashew
1/4c macadamia nuts
2T flax meal (ground flax seed)
1 clove crushed garlic
1T nutritional yeast
2t olive oil
1/4t salt
3T water
1T lemon juice

    * Grind all ingredients in a food processor until thoroughly mixed, leaving some texture to the nuts.
    * Press into plastic film lined individual tart cases *so you have a thin crust. You will find that regularly dipping your fingers in a bowl of water helps with this.
    * Place bases onto a mesh dehydrator sheet and dehydrate at 115 degrees F for 2 hours. They should now be firm enough to remove from the tart cases so you can continue to dehydrate them for a further 6 hours.

*Tart cases should be approx 11cm wide and no than about 1cm high, to allow the mixture (details to follow) to dehydrate inside.

For the filling
2c wild mushrooms (or substitute for any type of available mushroom)
1/2t salt
1T lemon juice

    * Wash and roughly chop the mushrooms, then marinate them in the salt and lemon juice and set aside.

2c courgettes (zucchini)
1/4c water
1 1/2c cashews
1/4c white miso
2t lemon juice
1/2 medium white onion
3T nutritional yeast
1T powdered psyllium husk
1/2t salt

    * Blend all ingredients in a high-powered blender until smooth.

2c tightly-packed spinach
2T olive oil
1/4t salt

    * Pulse spinach, olive oil and salt in a food processor for 10 to 20 seconds until broken down.
    * Drain the mushrooms from earlier and transfer them to a large bowl, along with the blended courgette (zucchini) mixture, and spinach. Then also mix in the following ingredients:

1/4c finely sliced spring onions
1c diced tomatoes
1T minced basil

    * Once thoroughly mixed, pour this mixture into the bases. You'll need to slightly overfill the bases as the filling will reduce slightly in the dehydrator.
    * Dehydrate overnight and during the day, for anything up to 24 hours.
    * Remove from the dehydrator and decorate with slices of tomato and fresh basil sprigs. It's also a good idea to brush the top of the quiche with a small amount of olive oil, to make them more appealing in their appearance.
