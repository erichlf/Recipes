1 1/2 c. sprouted chickpeas (garbanzo beans)
1 c. sprouted sunflower seeds
1 Tbl minced garlic
2 c. fresh cilantro, chopped
1/2 c. tahini
1/4 c. Nama Shoyu or 1 Tbl Celtic sea salt
2 Tbl fresh parsley
1/2 c. chopped onion
1/2 c. fresh-squeezed lemon juice
1/2 c. olive oil
1 1/2 tsp. Curry Chutney
1 1/2 tsp. cumin
2 tsp sun-dried lime

Combine all ingredients in a blender and blend well. Form blended mixture into 1-inch by 3-inch elongated patties, place them on an oiled mesh dehydrator sheet, and dehydrate for 8 hours at 90 degrees. When the falafel patties are done they have a nice crust on the outside and are moist on the inside.
