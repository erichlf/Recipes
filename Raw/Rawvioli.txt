Wrapper:
4 turnips


Peel the turnips. Slice the turnips into very thin slices, by cutting them in half and then using a Spiral Slicer, mandolin or other vegetable slicer to make thin round disks. These will be used as the wrapper which would normally be the pasta dough.


Cheese filling:
1 cup pine nuts
1 cup macadamia nuts
1 cup walnuts
6 t Bragg's
8 t lemon juice
2 cloves garlic
1 cup parsley


Blend the pine nuts, macadamia nuts and walnuts in a food processor until ground. Add the rest of the ingredients and blend well, until creamy.


Tomato Sauce:
2 large tomatoes
1/2 cup sun-dried tomatoes
1/4 fresh basil
1 clove garlic
6 dates
dash of olive oil (optional)


Soak the sun-dried tomatoes until soft. Blend in food processor, the tomatoes, sun-dried tomatoes, basil, and garlic until well blended. Add the dates and olive oil and blend until smooth. This sauce should be thick.


Directions for assembling the ravioli:
Remove a single turnip slice from the batch. Place a teaspoon full of cheese filling in the turnip slice and fold the turnip over until all the sides meet. Squeeze the edges together. Some of the filling will ooze out, but this is what will hold the edges together. Just put the excess back into the bowl to reuse. If you don't have enough filling in them they will not stick together. Place them in a single layer on a large plate and drizzle the tomato sauce on top, allow to sit for a few hours. The turnip will become soft from the tomato sauce. Use a spatula to scoop the ravioli's up and serve.
