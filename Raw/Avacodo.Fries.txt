Avocado Fries

Here is a simple and satisfying treat for when the fried food craving hits!
Slice up some avocado into 1/4-1/2 inch strips.

Tip: After slicing the avo in half score the flesh while it is still in the rind and then scoop out the meat and it will already be in strips.

Roll the avocado in a flax breading that is made up of:

1/2 cup ground flax seeds
1-2 tsp. garlic minced or powder
1 tsp. salt
1 tsp. oregano
1 Tbs. nutritional yeast

After breading the avocado slices you can dehydrate them for about an hour. 
This warms them up as well as allows some of the oils of the avocado to 
soak into the breading.
