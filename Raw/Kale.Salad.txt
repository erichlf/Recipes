kale salad:
-kale (obviously)
-apple cider vinegar(or any other acid- lemon juice, balsamic, whatever.....)
-oil (i used sesame and olive.  toasted sesame would be super good)
-minced garlic
-minced ginger ( i soak the garlic and ginger in the dressing for a while to infuse) 
-sesame seeds
-raisins, if you like (i soaked them in red wine)

i whisk the oil and vinegar to emulsify a little and let it sit with the garlic and ginger for a little while.
i just make enough to evenly coat the kale, not soak it.
sally's idea of massaging the kale with the dressing would make it more tender and yummy.

make this salad ahead of time.  the longer it marinates, the better.
