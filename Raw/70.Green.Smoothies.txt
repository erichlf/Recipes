70 Green Smoothie Recipes
Here are 70 green smoothie recipes from the 1st Green Smoothie Challenge. Remember to use pure water and organic produce for maximum results. You may like to add more or less water to the recipes depending on how thick or thin you like your smoothies. Feel free to experiment and create your own recipes.
