Ingredients: 
5 ears of corn (Cut the corn off the cob) 
4-5 heaping tbls of Ground flax 
1/2 tspn Sea Salt 
1 tbls of Cumin powder 

Place all ingredients into the Food Processor, except the ground flax. Start
grinding the corn until it becomes soupy and is well mixed. Start adding the
ground flax one tbls spoon at a time. Continue until the mixture starts to firm
and there is a noticeable difference in the motor of the processor, for me this
was just over 4 heaping tbls. Spread the mixture on a Tefflex sheet or wax paper
if you don't have tefflex. The thickness of the mixture and the dehydration time
will vary depending on what you are making. For Chips spread it about 1/8 of an
inch thick. For Crackers and Bread about 1/4 of an inch thick.

For Chips and Bread Dehydrate the mixture for 2-3 hours at 105deg or until you
can remove it easily form the tefflex, place the mixture on the screen and
continue for 3-4 hours more. Allow to cool, The chips should become crisp while
the bread will remain playable. For crackers double the dehydration times, allow
to cool for a crispness.
