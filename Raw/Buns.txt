Burger Buns

2 cups sprouted buckwheat
3/4 cup soaked whole flax seeds
3/4 cup carots
1/2 cup olive oil
1 tsp curry
1 tsp fresh rosemary (or 1/2 tsp dried)
1 tsp fresh thyme (or 1/2 tsp dried)
1 clove garlic
1 tsp sea salt
sesame seeds (optional)

1. Grind the carrots in a food processor until they are diced.
2. Add in other ingredients and blend well until dough-like.
3. Form into buns and place on mesh screens on dehydrator screens. Sprinkle with
sesame seeds if desired. Dehydrate at 105 degrees for 24 hours. These should be
firm but not hard.
