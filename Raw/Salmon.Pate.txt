Version 1: 

A delicious pink pate with a hint of salmon flavor! I eat this all the time on top of a large salad with a vinaigrette dressing. Itâ€™s such an easy pate to prepare and oh so delicious!

2 cups walnuts
2 stalks celery
1 large red bell pepper
1 large scallion
1/2 -1 tsp sea salt

Combine all ingredients in a food processor and blend until smooth.

Serving suggestions: This can be served on a plate as is, over a salad, rolled up in a green leaf, or spread on crackers.

Version 2:

Are you after a hale and hearty raw food meal? This one does it! Have a dinner party for your SAD eating friends or family and serve this as the main course. Their lives will change and you'll be a hero!

Ingredients (always use organically grown)

1. 2 cups almonds, soaked overnight
2. 1 cup celery, finely chopped (about 4 stalks)
3. 1/2 cup green onions, chopped
4. 1/4 cup purified water
5. 2 med. or large carrots
6. 3 tsp. lemon juice
7. finely chopped whole dulse leaf (avoid the flakes - they are heated and not healthful).
8. 1 head Romaine lettuce
9. Small handful of parsley sprigs
10. Optional: 3 red bell peppers

Instructions

1. Run the almonds through a Champion juicer, with the blank in place, to make a smooth pate.
2. Mix all ingredients except the lettuce or bell peppers together in a bowl, adding the dulse to taste.
3. Form the mixture into a rounded (or other shape) loaf and garnish with parsley greens.
4. To serve, spoon the loaf onto the lettuce leaves, and roll them up sushi-style, or optionally, spoon onto halved bell peppers, or stuff into cored whole bell peppers.
