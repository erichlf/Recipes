For the wrappers

Make 2 batches of this wrapper recipe for 8 pillows.

5c peeled courgette (zucchini)
3T olive oil
2t Lime juice
1/2t cayenne
1t ground coriander
1/2t salt
1/4c flax meal*

    * Blend all ingredients in a high-speed blender until smooth.

    * Add flax meal and blend again until smooth.

    * Pour mixture onto a dehydrator sheet and spread evenly into a square. you can choose the size, but for the ones in the photo the mixture was spread 26cm x 26cm square.

    * Dehydrate for 8 hours at 105 degrees F, or until able to peel of the sheet.

    * Once the dehydrator sheets are removed, return to the dehydrator for 30 mins, until both sides are dry to the touch but still pliable.

* Flax meal is flax seed that have been ground in a coffee grinder or similar, to produce a fine flour.

For the filling
5c white cabbage, shredded
6 spring onions (scallions)
2t cumin
2t ground coriander
1/4c cold pressed sesame oil
1T toasted sesame oil (optional)
1t salt
2T tamari or nama shoyu
2t lime juice
2 cloves garlic, crushed/minced
2 red Thai chilies, deseeded and minced
2T agave
2T tamarind paste (optional)
1c fresh coriander, roughly chopped

    * Combine all ingredients thoroughly in a bowl.

To assemble

    * Cut each of the wrapper squares from the dehydrator trays, which should still be pliable, into 4 equal squares.

    * Start with one of those smaller squares in front of you so that one corner is close to you.

    * Place a good amount of the filling mixture into the centre of the square.

    * Fold up the corner that is closet to you into the centre, then fold up the left and right corners so that you form an envelope. You will need to wet the edges as you go along so they stick in place.

    * Fold down the final corner, as if you were closing an envelope and use water to stick it down (you will find that youâ€™ll get better at this the more you do).

    * Place on a dehydrator mesh tray.

    * When all 8 are done, return to the dehydrator for a further 1 to 2 hours at 105 degrees F. Serve with dipping sauce.

    * Dehydrate any left-over cabbage mix until crispy; it makes a great addition to any salad.

For the dipping sauce
1 cucumber, peeled
1 mango, skin removed
1/4t salt
1t lime juice
1 spring onion, finely chopped
1 small handful fresh coriander

    * Blend all ingredients, except spring onions, until smooth.

    * Add most of the spring onion and all the coriander and pulse in.

    * Pour sauce into a small bowl and top with remaining spring onion
