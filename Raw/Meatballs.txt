Meatballs
(makes 16-20 meatballs)

1 cup mushroom, minced
1 tsp. black pepper
1 tbs. nama shoyu
1 tbs. olive oil

1/2 cup cashew, soaked
1/4 cup almond, soaked
1/4 cup sunflower seeds, soaked
water

1 tsp. jalapeno, minced
1/4 cup sun-dried tomato, soaked for 20 minutes
1 tbs. parsley, minced

1/4 cup flax seed, ground
1/2 tsp. salt

Toss the mushrooms with the olive oil, nama shoyu and pepper, then dehydrate for
30 minutes at 105F.

Drain the soaked nuts, add to the vita-mix with barely enough water to break the
nuts almost completely down. You want a little texture left. Remove and add to a
mixing bowl.

Add the dehydrated mushroom, sun-dried tomatoes, jalapeno and parsley to the vita mix and puree. Add to the nut mixture and combine with 1 tbs. of the ground flax seed.

Form the mixture into roughly 1" balls and roll around in the ground flax seed and salt mixture to completely coat. Place in the dehydrator for 6-8 hours at 105F, rotating halfway through. If needed, you can re-shape them around this time.
