black sesame sunflower bread

1 c ground flaxseed
1/3 c flax seed whole
½ t sea salt
1 clove garlic minced-optional for savory bread
2 T onion, minced-optional for savory bread
1-1/3 c water
2/3 c sunflower seeds
¼ c black sesame seeds

in large bowl mix ground flax, flax, salt, garlic, onion & water. Mix well
add sunflower & sesame seeds, mix well.

Spread on 1 telfex tray smooth out into an even square.
Dry at 104 degrees for 4 hours (mine was good in 3hr at 115 degrees)
Flip & score bread into 9 (or 12 like me) slices (I use a pizza cutter.)
Dehydrate another hour, before serving.
Serve warm.

Under dehydrate for immediate use, it’s softer. Lasts several days in fridge.
But fully dehydrate the bread for longer storage & trips. 1-2 months refrigerated.
