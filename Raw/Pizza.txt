Buckwheat Crust:
500g (approx 3c) buckwheat, sprouted for a few days until it has a small ‘tail’
2 avocados or 1/2c almond butter
1/4c olive oil
1/4c fresh basil
3T Italian seasoning
1/2c sun-dried tomatoes
3T lemon juice
1/2t salt
3 medium tomatoes

• Grind all ingredients in a food processor until you have a paste consistency.•
Spread onto a Paraflexx sheet in a circle and dehydrate for a few hours or until
you are able to turn it upside down onto another dehydrator tray and peel off
the plastic Paraflexx sheet.• Dehydrate for another 8 to 10 hours or until base
is dry enough to hold together.

For the caramelised onions
5 large onions, sliced thinly (use a mandoline if you have one)
1c soft dates
3T tamari
2T olive oil
1/4c water

• Blend all ingredients except the onions in a high-speed blender, until smooth.
• In a bowl, hand-mix the date mixture with the onions until they are thoroughly covered.
• Dehydrate on a Paraflexx sheet for 2 to 3 hours, so they soften and take on a
cooked appearance.

I used different recipes for the pesto (I make a big batch in the summer when I
have basil in the garden and keep it in the freezer for the winter), tomato
sauce, and cheese (I used Rawvolution's sunflower seed cheese), but here are
Russell's...

For the pesto
2c basil
1/4c pine nuts
1T olive oil

• Pulse all ingredients in a food processor until broken down, but leaving some
texture to the finished pesto.

For the tomato sauce
10 basil leaves
1c sun-dried tomatoes
1c tomatoes
