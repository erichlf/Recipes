Ingredients
    1/2 C. apple-cider vinegar
    2 T. soy sauce
    1 T. light-brown sugar
    1/4 t. ground ginger
    1/4 t. ground yellow mustard seed or dry mustard
    1/4 t. onion powder
    1 small clove garlic, crushed
    pinch ground cinnamon
    pinch freshly ground black pepper

Directions
    Step 1
    Place all ingredients in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high
    heat; reduce heat to a simmer and cook until liquid is reduced by half,
    about 20 minutes. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve and let cool completely
    before using. Worcestershire sauce may be stored in an airtight container,
    refrigerated, for up to 3 months.
