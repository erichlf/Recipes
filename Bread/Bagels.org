#+DESCRIPTION: Plain Bagels
* Ingredients
- 1 1/2 C Water (105F to 110F)
- 2 1/4 tsp Active Dry Yeast
- 4 C Bread Flour
- 2 T Molasses
- 2 tsp Kosher Salt
- 4 tsp Sugar
- 2 tsp Baking Soda for water

* Method:
1. Place 1 1/2 C of the tepid water in a bowl and dissolve the yeast
   completely; set aside.
2. Combine flour, molasses, salt, and sugar in a large bowl.
3. Add yeast mixture.
4. Knead yeast, water, flour mixture until dough is smooth and stretchy.
5. Shape dough into a ball and place it in a large oiled bowl, turning it to
   coat in oil.
6. Cover the bowl with a damp towel and let the dough rise in a
   warm place, until doubles in size.
7. Turn the dough out onto a dry surface and divide into 12 equal pieces.
8. Roll each piece into a 9-inch-long rope, moisten the ends with water,
   overlap the ends by about 1 inch, and press to join so you've created a ring.
9. Cover the shaped bagels with a damp towel and let rest 10 minutes.
10. Preheat oven to 425F.
11. Fill a large, wide, shallow pan with boiling water (for steaming).
12. After resting, stretch the dough to retain the quarter-size hole.
13. Bring a baking soda and water to a boil in a medium pot.
14. Reduce water to a simmer and place the bagels in the water, making sure
    they have room to bob around. Cook for about 30 seconds on each side until
    the bagels have a shriveled look, then remove to a baking sheet with a
    rack in it.
15. Arrange the bagels on the baking sheet lined with parchment paper about
    1 inch apart and bake. Rotate the pan after 15 minutes and bake until the
    bagels are a deep caramel color and have formed a crust on the bottom and
    top, about 10 more minutes.
16. Remove from the oven and let cool on a rack for at least 30 minutes so the
    interiors finish cooking and the crusts form a chewy exterior.
