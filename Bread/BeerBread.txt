Beer Bread Recipe #73440
There are a few recipes for Beer Bread out there, but none as simple (and
tasty!) as this one. You can even mix it in the baking pan for easy clean up.
This is sensational when served with soups or just as a snack, but don't expect
it to be around very long when your family gets a taste of it!

1 hour | 3 min prep

SERVES 6 -8
    * 3 cups flour (sifted)
    * 3 teaspoons baking powder (omit if using Self-Rising Flour)
    * 1 teaspoon salt (omit if using Self-Rising Flour)
    * 1/4 cup sugar
    * 1 (12 ounce) can beer
    * 1/2 cup melted butter (1/4 cup will do just fine)

   1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
   2. Mix dry ingredients and beer.
   3. Pour into a greased loaf pan.
   4. Pour melted butter over mixture.
   5. Bake 1 hour, remove from pan and cool for at least 15 minutes.
   6. UPDATED NOTES: Sifting flour for bread recipes is a must-do. Most people
	 just scoop the 1 cup measure in the flour canister and level it off. That
	 compacts the flour and will turn your bread into a "hard biscuit" as some
	 have described. That's because they aren't sifting their flour! If you do not
	 have a sifter, use a spoon to spoon the flour into the 1 cup measure. Try it
	 once the "correct" way and you will see an amazing difference in the end
	 product.
   7. I have had many email from you kind folks about using non-alcoholic
	 beverages instead of beer. That is fine to do but I highly recommend adding a
	 packet of Dry Active Yeast or 2 teaspoons of Bread (Machine) Yeast so that
	 you get a proper rise.
   8. The final result should be a thick, hearty and very tasteful bread, NOT A BRICK! ;).
   9. Thank you all for the incredibly nice comments and those of you who left a
	 bad review - learn to sift sift SIFT! You will be amazed at the results you
	 get.
