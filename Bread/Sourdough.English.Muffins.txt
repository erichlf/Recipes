Sponge:
33% Sourdough Starter (100% Hydration)
77% Flour
82% Milk

Dough:
23% Flour
7% Sugar
3% Salt
2% Baking Soda

Method:

In a medium bowl, mix the sponge ingredients until just combined. Cover and let rest for 8 hours or overnight.
Add the final dough ingredients and mix to roughly combine. Turn the dough out onto the counter and hand mix for about 7 or 8 minutes, or until the surface becomes quite smooth. The dough will be very soft, and sticky at first. Resist the urge to add more flour; it will become less sticky with mixing.
Flour the counter and your hands well, and roll or pat the dough out to a thickness of about one-half inch. Cut the dough into 3-inch circles and place them on semolina-dusted parchment paper.
Cover and let proof for 45 â€“ 60 minutes.
Lightly oil a griddle and heat it over medium-low heat. Cook the muffins for a total of about 7 or 8 minutes on each side, until browned and the sides are firm. I find I get a better shape to the muffins if I flip them every couple of minutes for the first few minutes.
Cool on a wire rack. To get the best nooks and crannies for toasting, split the muffins with a fork rather than a knife
