#+DESCRIPTION: Sourdough English Muffins
* Ingredients:
** Sponge:
- 33% Sourdough Starter (100% Hydration)
- 77% Flour
- 82% Milk

** Dough:
- 23% Flour
- 7% Sugar
- 3% Salt
- 2% Baking Soda

* Method:
1. In a medium bowl, mix the sponge ingredients until just combined.
2. Cover and let rest for 8 hours or overnight.
3. Add the final dough ingredients and mix to roughly combine.
4. Turn the dough out onto the counter and knead until the dough becomes smooth and elastic.
5. Flour the counter and your hands well, and roll or pat the dough out to a thickness of about one-half inch.
6. Cut the dough into 3 inch circles and place them on semolina-dusted parchment paper.
7. Cover and let proof for 45 â€“ 60 minutes.
8. Lightly oil a griddle and heat it over medium-low heat.
9. Cook the muffins for a total of about 7 or 8 minutes on each side, until browned and the sides are firm.
10. Cool on a wire rack. To get the best nooks and crannies for toasting, split the muffins with a fork rather than a knife
