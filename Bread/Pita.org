#+DESCRIPTION: An easy pita bread
* Ingredients:
- 2 1/4 tsp Instant Dry Yeast
- 1/2 C Warm Water
- 3 C Flour
- 1 1/4 tsp Salt
- 1 tsp Sugar
- 1 C Lukewarm Water

* Method:
1. Dissolve yeast in 1/2 C of warm water.
2. Add sugar and stir until dissolved and let sit for 10-15 minutes until water is frothy.
3. Combine flour and salt in large bowl.
4. Make a small depression in the middle of flour and pour yeast water in depression.
5. Slowly add 1 C of warm water, and stir until elastic.
6. Place dough on floured surface and knead until dough is smooth and elastic.
7. Coat large bowl with oil and place dough in bowl, rolling so all of the dough is coated.
8. Let rise until doubled in size.
9. Roll out in a rope, and pinch off 10-12 small pieces.
10. Place balls on floured surface and let sit covered, with moist towel, for 10 minutes.
11. Preheat oven to 500F and make sure rack is at the very bottom of oven. Be sure to preheat
    the baking sheet also.
12. Roll out each ball of dough with a rolling pin into 1/4 inch thick circles.
13. Bake each circle for 4 minutes until the bread puffs up (sometimes they don't puff up, but they
    still taste great).
14. Turn over and bake for 2 minutes.
15. Remove each pita from the baking sheet and add additional pitas for baking.
